= Investigating Complex Data Relationships Through Graphs

== Abstract
In this connected world we live in, traditional data stores often make it rather difficult to find valuable relationships in your data.
By making relationships first class citizens in the data model (and storing your data exactly as you'd whiteboard it), contextualizing a set of data becomes incredibly simple.
In this session, an engineer from Neo4j (http://www.neo4j.com/), the world's leading graph database, will walk through what a graph database is, and how it can transform your applications.
She will go over creating, querying, and displaying data, and give you the tools needed to use the graph.
She will also review the Panama Papers/Paradise Papers use case.
There is also a demo with some of the data in the Paradise Papers and information on how to explore the data for yourself!
Join us to learn how graph databases were used to identify key names in the biggest leaks and the largest cross-border investigation in journalism history with over 13.4 million documents!
