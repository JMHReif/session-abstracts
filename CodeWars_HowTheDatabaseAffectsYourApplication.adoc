= Code Wars - How the Database Affects Your Application

== Abstract
With the ever-increasing importance of data and the ability to quickly capture and access it, it is essential to choose the best methods.
Developers write applications to store and retrieve the data underneath but may not know the dramatic impact the lower layer has on their code or their work.
Maybe the data layer isn't something that keeps developers up at night, but maybe it should.

We know that different business needs or standards drive towards one technology or another, but how can we truly know which is the best technology for the job?
Do we understand why the existing practice became standard, or can we improve our lives with a better way?

In this session, we will learn how different data sources and a variety of query languages impact the amount of code required to store and retrieve data.
We will compare and contrast databases connecting to a typical Java application to understand where each makes life easier or harder for us as developers.
From relational to NoSQL to graph, we will explore various types of data - the way it is stored underneath and how best to go about retrieving it.
Learn which query languages fit the data store and how that also impacts the developer skillsets required to best leverage it and the code complexity.
A live-coding demo will bring all this to life, as the presenter shows exactly how your database choices change how you write applications.

Come to this session to find out whether the solution actually fits the need, and if it doesn't, how to provide valuable criteria and reasoning for a change!
