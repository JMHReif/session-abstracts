= Import Dread: Why Is Data Ingestion So Hard?

== Alternate Titles
* Does Data Import Have to Suck Your Life Away?

== Short Abstract
Today's technology environment consists of numerous options for databases and types of data stores, but there is one capability that isn't yet universal - data import.
No matter what we do, data seems to exist in differing formats or require human intervention in order to structure it for easy ingestion.

In this session, we will take a closer look at some ways to import different types of data into different types of data stores.
From extra tools and helpful hints to vendor-provided solutions, come and learn how to reduce your project's critical path and focus more on business needs by simplifying the data import process!

== Abstract
Today's technology environment consists of numerous options for databases and types of data stores, but there is one capability that isn't yet simple or universal - data import.
No matter what we (as developers) do, data seems to exist in differing formats or require human intervention in order to structure it for ingestion.

Whether dealing with new data, migrating data, or translating/integrating data, we must write code to process these flows of data across systems and various structures for analysis.
These processes can consume a surprising amount of planning, time, and frustration.
Plus, they must handle changing data, business requirements, and system upgrades.
Can we avoid these headaches? Or at least reduce them?

In this session, we will take a closer look at some of the ways to import different types of data into different types of data stores.
From extra tools and helpful hints to vendor-provided solutions, come and learn how to reduce your project's critical path and focus more on business needs by simplifying the data import process!

== Notes to committee/motivation
It seems that no matter the database, the longest pole in the tent is getting the data transported from one system or format to another. I wanted to explore the various ways/tools and show how each provides positive and negative experiences for different scenarios.
