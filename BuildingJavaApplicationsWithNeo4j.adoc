== Elevator pitch (300 characters or less)
Many of us have built applications for relational data structures, but is it different for graph data? In this session, we will cover a brief intro to graphs and build a typical Java application for a graph database. Join us to see how to amplify the power of connected data with applications!

== Short Abstract
Many of us have built applications for traditional data structures (like relational database tables), but is it different for graph data stores?

In this session, we will cover a brief intro to graphs and build a typical Java application for a graph database. We will interact with the graph data from the application, and explore some deployment possibilities.

Join us to see how to amplify the power of connected data with applications!

== Abstract
Many of us have built applications for traditional data structures (like relational database tables), but is it different for graph data stores? Do developers need to retool and relearn?

In this session, we will cover a brief intro to graphs and walk through writing a typical Java application with Spring and connect it to a graph database. We will walk through interacting with the graph data from the application, and show it in the cloud, as well.

Come to this session to apply your business applications to graph data!

== Notes to committee/motivation
I want to show how applications differ or are the same using a graph data structure compared to other types of data. Whether approaching a business problem or simply understanding applications with graph databases, I want to share and encourage developers to use graphs where appropriate!
